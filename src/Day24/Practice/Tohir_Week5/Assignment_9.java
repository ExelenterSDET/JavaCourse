//Task 9
//        Create a non-static method whose name is letsGuess().
//        It does not take any parameter.
//        Return type is void.
//        This method produces a random number, say, secretNumber.
//        In this method you must continue to guess number(s) until you hit the correct number which is the secretNumber.
//        Method prints "Guess a number between 0 and 100 (inclusive): " in the beginning of the game.
//        When the guess number is less than the secretNumber then print "Your number is small. Try a bigger number: ".
//        When the guess number is more than the secretNumber then print "Your number is big. Try a smaller number: ".
//        When the guess number is equal to the secretNumber then print "You won. Congrats!". And stop execution.
//        When the guess is not a valid number (including any letter or special character)
//          then print "Please enter a valid number: ". This counts as a wrong guess.
//        The maximum number of guess attempts is 5.
//        If the guesses reach to 5 than print "You lost! Better chance next time." And stop execution.
//        Note:
//         1) For guessing a number Scanner class is used.
//         2) The method is not a static method.
