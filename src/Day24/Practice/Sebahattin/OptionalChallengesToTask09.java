    Optional Challenge 1:

    Modify the re-guess message as follows:
        Each time the player have a wrong guess,
        - if the player has more than one guess, then the message should be like
            "Your number is small. Try a bigger number (4 guesses left): " or
            "Your number is big. Try a smaller number (2 guesses left): " or
            "Please enter a valid number (3 guesses left): "
        - if the player has only one guess left, then the message should be like
            "Your number is small. Try a bigger number (Only one guess left): " or
            "Your number is big. Try a smaller number (Only one guess left): " or
            "Please enter a valid number (Only one guess left): "

    Optional Challenge 2:

        When the game is over, ask player if he/she wants to play again by printing the following menu.
          "Do you want to play again?"
          "Press 1 if you want to continue playing."
          "Press 0 if you do NOT want to continue."
        If player types 1 then re-start the game.
        If player types 0 then stop executing.
        If player enter something else then keep asking and print
          "Please enter a valid option!"
          "Press 1 if you want to continue playing."
          "Press 0 if you do NOT want to continue."
