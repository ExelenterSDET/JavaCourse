Task 1.

public enum Product {
    1. In this enum you should create following attributes:
        COMPUTER, name of product = "Macbook", buy price = 1000.50, sell price = 1200.30
        PHONE, name of product = "Iphone", buy price = 800.40, sell price = 875.95,
        TABLET, name of product = "IPad", buy price = 250, sell price = 285.35,
        PLAYSTATION, name of product = "PS4", buy price = 450.10, sell price = 500.05;

    2. Create Constructor, and getter methods.
}

public enum TransactionType {
    1. In this enum you have to create following attributes:
        BUY, SELL
}

public class Transaction {
    1. Create following attributes:
        double totalUSDAmount (should be class attribute and accessible for all classes)
        HashMap<String, Integer> stock (should be class attribute, not editable and accessible for all classes)
        double transactionAmount (should be class object attribute and accessible only within the class)

    2. Create a method named as addFunds. It should update totalUSDAmount. (should be class method and accessible for all classes)

    3. Create a method named as processTransaction (method should be a public class method)
       Parameters:
       TransactionType,
       Product,
       int qty
       -- In this method, depending on TransactionType, you should assign value to transactionAmount.
            --- if TransactionType is BUY, use Product buy price multiplied by qty
            --- if TransactionType is SELL, use Product sell price multiplied by qty
       -- Depending on TransactionType, you should switch between the methods buyProduct() or sellProduct().
       Note: probably you should first create steps 5 and 6 (create methods buyProduct() and sellProduct())

    4. Create a method named as buyProduct (method should be a private class object method)
       Parameters:
       Product
       int qty
       -- if qty is less or equal 0, then print Wrong amount and do not take any actions.
           --- if qty is greater then 0, but transactionAmount is greater then totalUSDAmount, then print following:
                "Your purchase amount is " + transactionAmount
                "Your available balance is " + totalUSDAmount
                "Not enough funds to cover your purchase. Please try less qty or add more funds. "
           --- if not above conditions,
                deduct transactionAmount from totalUSDAmount
                update/add to stock MAP. Key -> Product`s name, Value -> qty

    5. Create a method named as sellProduct (method should be a private class object method)
       Parameters:
       Product
       int qty
        -- if qty is less or equal 0, then print Wrong amount and do not take any actions.
            -- in this method you will check the Map stock. If you don`t have Product in stock, or don`t have enough quantity to sell print:
                "Your stock for " + {product name} + " is " + {product stock amount}
                "You don`t have enough stock. Please try less qty"
            --- if not above conditions,
                add transactionAmount to totalUSDAmount
                update/deduct from stock MAP. Key -> Product`s name, Value -> qty
        }

    6. Create a static print method.
        Print TotalUSD, stock

public class Shop {

        Use this class for Test methods.

        Test Case 1.
        Add funds and validate it is updated.
