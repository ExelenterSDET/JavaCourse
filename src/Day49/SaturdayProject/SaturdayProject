        COMPUTER, name of product = "Macbook", buy price = 1000.50, sell price = 1200.30
        PHONE, name of product = "Iphone", buy price = 800.40, sell price = 875.95,
        TABLET, name of product = "IPad", buy price = 250, sell price = 285.35,
        PLAYSTATION, name of product = "PS4", buy price = 450.10, sell price = 500.05;

    2. Create Constructor, and getter methods.
}

public enum TransactionType {
    1. In this enum you have to create following attributes:
        BUY, SELL
}

public class Transaction {
    1. Create following attributes:
        double totalUSDAmount (should be class attribute and accessible for all classes)
        HashMap<String, Integer> stock (should be class attribute, not editable and accessible for all classes)
        double transactionAmount (should be class object attribute and accessible only within the class)

    2. Create a method named as addFunds. It should update totalUSDAmount. (should be class method and accessible for all classes)

    3. Create a method named as processTransaction (method should be a public class method)
       Parameters:
       TransactionType,
       Product,
       int qty
       -- In this method, depending on TransactionType, you should assign value to transactionAmount.
            --- if TransactionType is BUY, use Product buy price multiplied by qty
            --- if TransactionType is SELL, use Product sell price multiplied by qty
       -- Depending on TransactionType, you should switch between the methods buyProduct() or sellProduct().
       Note: probably you should first create steps 5 and 6 (create methods buyProduct() and sellProduct())

    4. Create a method named as buyProduct (method should be a private class object method)
       Parameters:
       Product
       int qty
       -- if qty is less or equal 0, then print Wrong amount and do not take any actions.
           --- if qty is greater then 0, but transactionAmount is greater then totalUSDAmount, then print following:
                "Your purchase amount is " + transactionAmount
                "Your available balance is " + totalUSDAmount
                "Not enough funds to cover your purchase. Please try less qty or add more funds. "
           --- if not above conditions,
                deduct transactionAmount from totalUSDAmount
                update/add to stock MAP. Key -> Product`s name, Value -> qty

    5. Create a method named as sellProduct (method should be a private class object method)
       Parameters:
       Product
       int qty
        -- if qty is less or equal 0, then print Wrong amount and do not take any actions.
            -- in this method you will check the Map stock. If you don`t have Product in stock, or don`t have enough quantity to sell print:
                "Your stock for " + {product name} + " is " + {product stock amount}
                "You don`t have enough stock. Please try less qty"
            --- if not above conditions,
                add transactionAmount to totalUSDAmount
                update/deduct from stock MAP. Key -> Product`s name, Value -> qty
        }

    6. Create a static print method.
        Print TotalUSD, stock

public class Shop {

        Use this class for Test methods.

        Test Case 1.
        Add funds and validate it is updated.

        Test Case 2.
        Add funds, and buy 1 Product.
        validate funds are updated and product has been added to the map.

        Test Case 3.
        Add funds, and buy 2 Products.
        validate funds are updated and product has been added to the map.

        Test Case 4.
        Sell product and validate no updates happened in the funds and in the map.

        Test Case 5.
        Add funds.
        Buy Multiple products.
        Sell Multiple products.
        Validate funds and your stock for each product.
}

Task 2 ---- PRINT LUCKY USERS Who registered in the first 10 seconds ----

public class User {
    in this class you should have following attributes:

    name ==> should be accessible in all classes.
    LocalDateTime registration ==> should be accessible in all classes.

    1. Create Constructor with parameter name.
       -- in the constructor assign value to name, and create a current date.

   2. Create toString method. Print only name.
}


public class Registration {
    in this class you should have following attributes:
    LocalDateTime startTime ==> should be accessible only in the current class

    1. create a public method named as register.
       -- method should return List of Users

       -- In this method you should do:
       -- initialize current time.

          --- Use Scanner to enter name.
          --- using this name, create a USER
          --- add a USER object to the List of Users.
          --- keep entering names in Scanner, until you type EXIT. If you type EXIT, exit the scanner.

    2. create a method named as printHappyUsers.
       Parameter: List of Users
       Print only those users, who have been registered within first 10 seconds.

 }

public class Application {
    In  this class you will have a main method and you will run and print your code.
 }

        Sample output:
        **** SCANNER *****
