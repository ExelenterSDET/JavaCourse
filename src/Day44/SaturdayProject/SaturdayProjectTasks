Task 1
-	Create a class called Employee with following attributes:
    -- baseSalary
    -- hourlyRate
    -- numberOfEmployees (this field should be increased every time you create a new employee object - you shouldn't have a copy of this field for each object)
-	Create a constructor in Employee class to initialize baseSalary and hourlyRate
    -- baseSalary cannot be less than or equal to zero
    -- hourlyRate cannot be less than zero
    -- If these conditions are not true while initializing baseSalary and hourlyRate, then return hourlyRate = 14.20
    Note: baseSalary = (hourlyRate * 40)

-	Create a method in Employee class called calculateWage with a parameter extraHours.
    And this method should calculate the wage (wage = baseSalary + (hourlyRate * extraHours) * 1.5)

-	Create a method in Employee class (named as getNumberOfEmployees) to return the number of employees

-   Create a class TestSalaries
    -- create a test method to validate number of employees. (you should create multiple employees in the test method)
    -- create a test method to validate the total wage for one employee
    -- create another three methods, to validate any other possible scenarios

Task 2
    - Create a package crypto
    - under crypto package create classes Bitcoin and Ethereum (Note: both classes are similar and have same type of attributes and methods)
    - create following attributes:
        String shortname   ---> should be accessible in all packages. should be class attribute. should be constant: "BTC" for Bitcoin and "ETH" for Ethereum
        double totalAmount ---> should be accessible only within the same class and be a class attribute.
        double totalValue  ---> should be accessible only within the same class and be a class attribute.
        int transactionId ---> should be instance attribute and accessible in all packages.
        double transactionAmount ---> should be instance attribute and accessible in all packages.
        double price ---> should be accessible only within the same class. should be constant. Note: value for Bitcoin clas is 19540.09 and for Ethereum class is 1329.17
        double transactionValue ---> should be instance attribute and accessible in all packages.

    - create a constructor
        -- parameter is transaction amount.
        assign value to class transactionAmount attribute.
        assign value to transactionValue (note: transactionValue = transactionAmount * price)
        add value to the totalAmount (note: this field should always increase and represents totalAmount of all class transactions)
        add value to the totalValue (note: this field should always increase and represents totalValue of all class transactions)

    - create a static method getTotalAmount
        should return totalAmount

     - create a static method getTotalValue
            should return totalValue

     - create a print method.
        print fields :
         transactionId
         transactionAmount
         price
         transactionValue

         Example:
         Bitcoin{transactionId=1, transactionAmount=1.2, price=19540.09, transactionValue=23448.108}
         Ethereum{transactionId=2, transactionAmount=1.0, price=19540.09, transactionValue=19540.09}

    - create another package as portfolio
    - create a class BuyCrypto
        transactionId
        HashMap<String, ArrayList<Double>> portfolio
        ArrayList<Bitcoin> bitcoinTransactions
        ArrayList<Ethereum> ethereumTransactions

        Note:
        -- all attributes are accessible only within the class.
        -- all attributes are class attributes.
        -- except transactionId, all other attributes are constant

    - create a constructor
        -- parameters are String crypto and double amount
        -- everytime when constructor is called, transactionId should be increased

        -- if parameter String crypto is bitcoin:
            --- create an object for Bitcoin
            --- assign value to Bitcoin`s transactionId value of BuyCrypto`s transactionId
            --- add object to the bitcoinTransactions list
            --- update portfolio map as follows:
                key should be Bitcoin shortname, value should be totalAmount and totalValue
                Example:
                Portfolio{{BTC=[1.2, 23448.108], ETH=[1.0, 1329.17]}}

         -- if parameter String crypto is ethereum:
                    --- create an object for Ethereum
                    --- assign value to Ethereum`s transactionId value of BuyCrypto`s transactionId
                    --- add object to the ethereumTransactions list
                    --- update portfolio map as follows:
                        key should be Ethereum shortname, value should be totalAmount and totalValue
                        Example:
                        Portfolio{{BTC=[1.2, 23448.108], ETH=[1.0, 1329.17]}}

        -- Create a method to print only the Portfolio (you may use toString method)
        -- Create a method to print all detailed crypto transactions. (print both ethereumTransactions and bitcoinTransactions lists)

        Example:
        Portfolio{{BTC=[1.2, 23448.108], ETH=[1.0, 1329.17]}}
        ===============TRANSACTIONS==================
        Bitcoin{transactionId=1, transactionAmount=1.2, price=19540.09, transactionValue=23448.108}
        Ethereum{transactionId=2, transactionAmount=1.0, price=1329.17, transactionValue=1329.17}
        ===============================================

        -- Create another package portfolio
        -- Create class CryptoMarket
        -- in the main method perform multiple transactions with different cryptos by calling BuyCrypto class.
        -- print the portfolio and detailed transactions.

        -- Optional:
            try to use Test methods and add some validations. (at least test three different scenarios)

Task 3
-   create class Numbers
    -- create method named as "checkEvenNumber",which returns true if provided integer is even
    -- create a method "evenNumbers" which will return all even number between 0 and 20

-   create class TestNumbers
    -- create method to check "checkEvenNumber" method
    -- create a method to check if "evenNumbers" method works as expected
    -- add another three methods, to validate any other possible scenarios

Task 4
    ======================practice String varargs===================================

    1. Create a method which will print String varargs in the reversed order.
       compile and run using terminal

       Example:
       Input: Java is Fun
       Output: Fun is Java

    2. Create a method which will return boolean
       If provided String is palindrome, return true. Else, return false.
       compile and run using terminal

       Example:
       Input: 123321
       Output: true

    3. Create a methods which will return total length of all Strings.
       compile and run using terminal.

        Example:
        Input: Java is Fun 2005
        Output:  4 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 13
